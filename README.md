# Identity And Trust Specifications

This repository contains normative documents defining protocols and flows withing the Identity and Trust system to be
used in Tractus-X projects.

The responsibility of the specification has been transfered to the [Eclipse Dataspace Working Group](https://dataspace.eclipse.org).
Please file change requests or contributions according to the working group processes.

Until the first version of the specification from the working group is released and implemented, this repository contains the
current specification implemented in the Catena-X data space. Maintenance is limited to urgent issues concerning the
operation of this data space.

There are [designated editors](./pr_etiquette.md#the-designated-editors-as-of-sept-21-2023), who are the primary
contributors to the content of this repository. Please file urgent issues that cannot wait for the first working
group release through GitHub Discussions or Issues.
