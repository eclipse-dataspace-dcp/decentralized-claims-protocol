# Decentralized Claims Protocol DCP

This repository contains normative documents defining protocols and flows of the Eclipse Decentralized Claims Protocol (DCP) defines an interoperable overlay to the [Dataspace Protocol (DSP)](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspace-protocol-base/DataspaceProtocol) Specifications for conveying organizational identities and establishing trust in a way that preserves privacy and limits the possibility of network disruption.

The scope of Eclipse DCP specification includes:

- Specifying a format for self-issued identity tokens
- Defining a protocol for storing and presenting Verifiable Credentials and other identity-related resources
- Defining a protocol for parties to request credentials from a credential issuer

Eclipse DCP supports multiple trust anchors and allow participants to manage and verify presentations without needing third-party systems outside their control. Note that it is not a requirement for Eclipse DCP to specify a decentralized or "self-sovereign" identity protocol, but it may be based on it.
