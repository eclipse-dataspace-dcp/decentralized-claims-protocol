# Decentralized Claims Protocol DCP

This repository contains normative documents defining protocols and flows of the Eclipse Decentralized Claims Protocol
Specification (DCP). The specification defines an interoperable overlay to
the [Dataspace Protocol Specification (DSP)](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspace-protocol-base/DataspaceProtocol) for
conveying organizational identities and establishing trust in a way that preserves privacy and limits the possibility of
network disruption.

The scope of the Eclipse DCP specification includes:

- Specifying a format for self-issued identity tokens
- Defining a protocol for storing and presenting Verifiable Credentials and other identity-related resources
- Defining a protocol for parties to request credentials from a credential issuer

Eclipse DCP supports multiple trust anchors and allows participants to manage and verify presentations without needing
third-party systems outside their control.

## Technology Compatibility Kit

Eclipse DCP includes a [Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK)](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspacetck/dcp-tck) that can be
used to test implementation compliance to the specification.
