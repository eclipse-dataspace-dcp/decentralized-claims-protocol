        The responsibility of the specification has been transfered to the <a href="https://dataspace.eclipse.org/">Eclipse
        Dataspace Working Group</a>.
        Please file
        change requests or contributions according to the working group processes. Until the first version of the
        specification from the working group is released and implemented, this repository contains the current
        specification implemented in the Catena-X data space. Maintenance is limited to urgent issues concerning the
        operation of this data space. There are <a
            href="https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx/identity-trust/blob/main/pr_etiquette.md#the-designated-editors-as-of-sept-21-2023">designated
        editors</a>,
        who are the primary contributors to the content of
        this repository. Please file urgent issues that cannot wait for the first working group release through GitHub
        Discussions or Issues.
