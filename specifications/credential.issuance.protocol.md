# Credential Issuance Protocol

The Credential Issuance Protocol defines the endpoints and message types for requesting [=Verifiable Credentials=] from
a [=Credential Issuer=]. The protocol is designed to handle use cases where credentials can automatically be issued and
where a manual workflow is required.

## Issuance Flow

The following sequence diagram depicts a non-normative flow where a client interacts with a [=Credential Issuer=] to
issue a [=Verifiable Credential=]:

![Issuance Flow](specifications/issuance.flow.svg "Issuance Flow")

1. The client sends a request to its [=Secure Token Service=] for a token including an access token. This could be a
   [=Self-Issued ID Token=]. The API used to make this request is implementation specific. The client may include a set
   of scopes that define the [=Verifiable Credentials=] the client wants the [=Issuer Service=] to provide. This set of
   scopes is determined out of band and may be derived from metadata the [=Credential Issuer=] has previously made
   available to the client.
2. The [=Secure Token Service=] responds with an access token, which may be included in the `token` claim of the
   [=Self-Issued ID Token=]. The access token can be used by the [=Issuer Service=] to write requested 
   [=Verifiable Credentials=] to the client's [=Credential Service=].
3. The client makes a request to the [=Issuer Service=] for one or more [=Verifiable Credentials=] and includes
   a [=Self-Issued ID Token=] containing the access token.
4. The [=Issuer Service=] resolves the client [=DID=] based on the value of the [=Self-Issued ID Token=] `sub` claim.
5. The [=DID Service=] returns the DID Document. The [=Issuer Service=] validates the [=Self-Issued ID Token=] following
   Section [[[#validating-self-issued-id-tokens]]].
6. The [=Issuer Service=] rejects the request or acknowledges receipt.
7. At a later point in time, if the [=Verifiable Credential=] request is approved, the [=Issuer Service=] uses the
   resolved DID Document to obtain the client's [=Credential Service=] endpoint as described in
   Section [[[#credential-service-endpoint-discovery]]] and sends the [=Verifiable Credentials=] to
   the [=Credential Service=]. The send operation is performed asynchronously from the client request.
8. The [=Credential Service=] validates the access token and stores the [=Verifiable Credentials=].

## Issuer Service Endpoint Discovery

The client [=DID Service=] MUST make the [=Issuer Service=] available as a `service` entry ([[[did-core]]], sect.
5.4) in the DID document that is resolved by its DID. The `type` attribute of the `service` entry MUST be
`IssuerService`.

The `serviceEndpoint` property MUST be interpreted by the client as the base URL of the [=Issuer Service=]. The
following is a non-normative example of a `Issuer Service` entry:

<aside class="example" title="Credential Service Entry in DID document">
    <pre class="json">
{
  "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",
      "https://w3id.org/dspace-dcp/v1.0/dcp.jsonld"
    ],
  "service": [
    {
      "id":"did:example:123#issuer-service",
      "type": "IssuerService", 
      "serviceEndpoint": "https://issuer.example.com"
    }
  ]
}
    </pre>
</aside>

## Issuer Service Base URL

All endpoint addresses are defined relative to the base URL of the [=Issuer Service=]. The [=Credential Issuer=] will
use the base URL for the `issuer` field in all [=Verifiable Credentials=] it issues as defined by the `issuer`
property ([[vc-data-model]]).

No assumptions are made about the base URL, for example, if it is a domain, subdomain, or contains a path.

## Credential Request API

The Credential Request API defines the REQUIRED [=Issuer Service=] endpoint for requesting [=Verifiable Credentials=].

The request MUST include an ID Token in the HTTP `Authorization` header prefixed with `Bearer` as defined in
the [[[#verifiable-presentation-access-token]]]. The `issuer` claim can be used by the [=Credential Service=] to resolve
the client's [=DID=] to obtain cryptographic material for validation and credential binding.

The ID Token MUST contain a `token` claim that is a bearer token granting write privileges for the
requested [=Verifiable Credentials=] into the client's `Credential Service` as defined
by [[[#verifiable-presentation-protocol]]]

The bearer token MAY also be used by the [=Issuer Service=] to resolve [=Verifiable Presentations=] the client is
required to hold for issuance of the requested [=Verifiable Credentials=].

If the issuer supports a pre-authorization code flow, the client MUST use the `pre-authorized_code` claim in the
Self-Issued ID Token to provide the pre-authorization code to the issuer.

### Credential Request Message

|              |                                                                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Schema**   | [JSON Schema](./resources/issuance/credential-request-message-schema.json)       |
| **Required** | - `@context`: Specifies a valid Json-Ld context ([[json-ld11]], sect. 3.1).      |
|              | - `type`: A string specifying the `CredentialRequestMessage` type                |
|              | - `holderPid`: A string corresponding to the request id on the Holder side type  |
|              | - `credentials`: an array of strings, each referencing a [[[#credentialobject]]] |

The following is a non-normative example of a `CredentialRequestMessage`:

<aside class="example" title="CredentialRequestMessage">
    <pre class="json" data-include="./resources/issuance/example/credential-request-message.json">
    </pre>
</aside> 

Each IDs in the `credentials` array MUST be one of the `id` values of an object in the `credentialsSupported` returned from the 
[[[#issuer-metadata-api]]]. When processing, the [=Issuer Service=] MUST resolve this string value to the respective object.

On successful receipt of the request, the [=Issuer Service=] MUST respond with a `201 CREATED` and the `Location`
header set to the location of the request status ([[[#credential-request-status-api]]])

The [=Issuer Service=] MAY respond with `401 Not Authorized` if the request is unauthorized or other `HTTP` status codes
to indicate an exception.

If the request is approved, the issuer endpoint will send an acknowledgement to the client. When
the [=Verifiable Credentials=] are ready, the [=Issuer Service=] will respond asynchronously with a write-request to the
client's `Credential Service` using the Storage API defined in Section [[[#storage-api]]].

## Storage API

The Storage API defines the REQUIRED [=Credential Service=] endpoint for writing issued credentials, typically invoked
by
an [=Issuer Service=].

If a client is not authorized for an endpoint request, the [=Credential Service=] SHOULD return `4xx Client Error`. The
exact error code is implementation-specific.

|              | - `rejectionReason`: a String containing additional information why a request was rejected. Can be `null`.           |

The following is a non-normative example of a [Credential Message](#credential-message) JSON body:

<aside class="example" title="Credential Message (issued)">
    <pre class="json" data-include="./resources/issuance/example/credential-message.json">
    </pre>
</aside>

The following example shows a rejected credential request JSON body:
<aside class="example" title="Credential Message (rejected)">
    <pre class="json" data-include="./resources/issuance/example/credential-message-rejected.json">
    </pre>
</aside>

Note that the `status` applies to the entire request, i.e. a request is considered _rejected_ if at least one credential
could not be issued.
Allowed values for the `status` are `"ISSUED"` and `"REJECTED"`. The `rejectionReason` field is optional and should not
disclose any confidential information.

### Credential Container

The [Credential Message](#credential-message)'s `credentials` property contains an array of `CredentialContainer`
objects.
The  [Credential Container](#credential-container) object contains the following properties:

|              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **Required** | - `credentialType`: A single string specifying type of credential. See [VC DataModel 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#types) or [VC DataModel 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/#types), respectively. |
|              | - `payload`: A Json Literal ([[json-ld11]], sect. 4.2.2) containing a [=Verifiable Credential=] defined by ([[vc-data-model]]).                                                                                            |
|              | - `format`:  a JSON string that describes the format of the credential to be issued                                                                                                                                        |

## Credential Offer API

Some scenarios involve the [=Credential Issuer=] making an initial offer. For example, an out-of-band process may result
in
a credential offer. Or, a [=Credential Issuer=] may start a key rotation process which requires
a [=Verifiable Credential=] to be
reissued. In this case, the [=Credential Issuer=] can proactively prompt a [=Holder=] to request a
new [=Verifiable Credential=]
during the key rotation period.

The Credential Offer API defines the REQUIRED [=Credential Service=] endpoint for notifying a [=Holder=] of
a [=Verifiable Credential=] offer.

|              | - `credentials`: A JSON array, where every entry is a JSON object of type [[[#credentialobject]]] or a JSON string |

If the `credentials` property entries are type string, the value MUST be one of the `id` values of an object in the
`credentialsSupported` returned from the [[[#issuer-metadata-api]]]. When processing, the [=Credential Service=]
MUST resolve this string value to the respective object.

## Issuer Metadata API

The Issuer Metadata API defines the REQUIRED [=Issuer Service=] endpoint for conveying verifiable credential types
supported by the [=Credential Issuer=].

## Credential Request Status API

The Credential Request Status API defines the REQUIRED [=Issuer Service=] endpoint for conveying the status of a
[=Verifiable Credential=] request.

| **Sent by**     | A client                                                                                                                                                |
| **HTTP Method** | `GET`                                                                                                                                                   |
| **URL Path**    | `/requests/<request id>`  where the request id corresponds to the ID identified by the location header returned for a [[[#credential-request-message]]] |
| **Response**    | [[[#credentialstatus]]] `HTTP 200`                                                                                                                      |     

The [=Issuer Service=] MUST implement access control such that only the client that made the request may access a
particular request status. A [=Self-Issued ID Token=] MUST be submitted in the HTTP `Authorization` header prefixed
with `Bearer` of the request.

|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Schema**   | [JSON Schema](./resources/issuance/credential-status-schema.json)           |
| **Required** | - `@context`: Specifies a valid Json-Ld context ([[json-ld11]], sect. 3.1). |
|              | - `type`: A string specifying the `CredentialStatus` type                   |
|              | - `issuerPid`: A string corresponding to the issuance id on the Issuer side |
|              | - `holderPid`: A string corresponding to the issuance id on the Holder side |
|              | - `status`: A string with a value of `RECEIVED`, `REJECTED`, or `ISSUED`    |

The following is a non-normative example of a `CredentialStatus` response object:

## Key Rotation and Revocation

[=Issuer Service=] implementations SHOULD support rotation and revocation of keys used to
create [=Verifiable Credential=] proofs.

### Key rotation

Key rotation may be supported in the following way:

1. After a defined `cryptoperiod`, a rotation is initiated, a new key pair is generated and the public key is added
   to a `verificationMethod` in the [=Credential Issuer=] DID document. The new private key is used to sign newly
   issued [=Verifiable Credential=] proofs.
2. The old private key is decommissioned (archived or destroyed). However, the `verificationMethod` in
   the [=Credential Issuer=] DID document are retained so existing issued [=Verifiable Credentials=] may be verified.
3. At some point before existing [=Verifiable Credentials=] are set to expire, an [=Credential Issuer=] may make
   credential offers for new [=Verifiable Credentials=] to [=Holders=] with the `offerReason = reissue` property.
4. After a defined period, the rotated key's `verificationMethod` will be removed from the [=Credential Issuer=] DID
   document. This period must at least extend to the expiration date of the last issued credential. At this point, any
   existing [=Verifiable Credentials=] with proofs signed by the old (now rotated) key will become invalid.

Implementors following this sequence SHOULD set the `expirationDate`/`validUntil` property of
issued [=Verifiable Credentials=] to less than the rotation period of the keys used to sign their proofs. Rotated keys
SHOULD not be decommissioned until all credentials, that were signed with it, have expired.

### Key revocation

Key revocation may be supported in the following way:

1. After revocation is initiated, a new key pair is generated and the public key is added to a `verificationMethod` in
   the [=Credential Issuer=] DID document. The new private key is used to sign newly issued [=Verifiable Credential=]
   proofs.
2. The old private key is decommissioned (archived or destroyed) and the `verificationMethod` in
   the [=Credential Issuer=] DID document is removed.
3. The [=Credential Issuer=] may make credential offers for new [=Verifiable Credentials=] to [=Holders=] with the
   `offerReason = proof-key-revocation` property.

Upon revocation of a key pair, all credentials that were issued and proofed with that key, immediately become invalid.

## Verifiable Credential Revocation

[=Verifiable Credential=] revocation MUST be supported using the [[[vc-bitstring-status-list-20230427]]] specification.
Note that implementations MAY support multiple lists.
