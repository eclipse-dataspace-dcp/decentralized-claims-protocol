## Introduction

This document outlines a series of tests that various participants in an identity network based on IATP must pass. Such
a system typically consists of two participants, where one party proves to the other party a series of claims. Those
claims are represented as a series of VerifiableCredentials, which the proving party presents in the form of a
VerifiablePresentation. The relying party then verifies those claims against or with the help of established
cryptographic primitives and systems.
Where applicable, this document also provides test vectors in the form of `*.json` files.

## Definition of terms

For the purposes of this document, term definitions from
the [specifications](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspace-dcp/decentralized-claims-protocol) apply, unless stated otherwise. In
addition, the following terms apply:

- proving party: the party that makes certain claims about themselves
- relying party: the party that wants to verify a certain claim
- LDP: Linked Data Proof, synonymous for VCs/VPs in the JSON-LD format
- JWT-VC, JWT-VP: VCs/VPs in the Json Web Token format
- Verification: the process of ensuring the cryptographic validity of a previously signed data structure.
- Validation: the process of ensuring that a data structure is in an acceptable form. This can involve checking that
  certain properties are there, that values fall within an acceptable range, etc. Validation may be dependent on other
  data structures.
- Context: refers to the `@context` section of a JSON-LD document

## Verifying JWTs

Although technically it does not involve any cryptographic operation, it must be made sure that the basic formal
structure of the JWT standard is adhered to. So evey verification/validation operation must implicitly validate that,
otherwise subsequent steps are not possible. Note that this section is not specific to VC/VP JWTs. Refer
to [the JWT specification, section 7.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519#section-7.2).

## Validating SI tokens as the relying party

This section outlines tests that need to be passed on the _relying side_, when receiving Self-issued ID
tokens that contain a `token`.
Please read details [here](./verifier.md)

## Validating SI tokens in the CredentialService

This sections outlines tests that the CredentialService needs to pass, when receiving back another
Self-issued ID token as Auth header on the `/presentation/query` endpoint.
Please read details [here](./credentialservice)

## End-To-End tests

To be written - this outlines tests, that view the CredentialService as a black box. For example, it would specify a
case
where the CredentialService receives

## Implementer's notice: certification of compliance

The following section outlines several ways how conformance with this test plan can be established.

### 1. Via test annotations

Assuming a JVM language, the implementor simply puts special annotations onto test methods to enable subsequent tooling
to generate conformance reports.

For example:

```java

@IatpTest(number = "J_0010")
@DisplayName("VP: reject expired JWT")
void verifyJwt_rejectExpired() {
    // test code
}

@IatpTest(number = "J_0009", disabled = true, reason = "Not supported in this version")
void verifyJwt_rejectJwt_withoutKidHeader() {
}
```

Be aware that since this is in essence a self-proclaimed conformance report, the implementation may be marked as having
limited compliance.

### 1. Embedding in client code

For implementations that are based on a JVM-language, a test framework will be provided, containing an SPI to which test
subjects can delegate test execution. Practically, implementors simply inherit a test base class that contains all test
code and that only delegates back to client code for business logic invocations, such as creating keys. Throwing
an `UnsupportedOperationException` in client code marks the test as "disabled".

For example, to verify the correct signing of a VC, the test framework would set up test data (i.e. a JSON-LD file
containing a VC) and possibly generate a keypair, and would pass the JSON-LD back into the test subject for signing. The
test subject signs it, and returns it to the test framework, where it is subsequently validated.

Tests are self-contained and quick to execute. In order to ensure continued and reproducible compliance, it is advisable
to execute test tests in a CI/CD environment.

### 2. Remote execution of tests

If the implementation is done in another programming language, or if the aforementioned approach is not suitable for
some other reason, a remote test execution framework may be implemented, where subjects-under-test implement a simple
and standardized REST API, over which it receives the test data, invokes the appropriate methods, and then sends back
the results to the (remote) test framework.

Returning an HTTP 204 No Content marks the test as "disabled".

That way, the implementation of the tests and the implementation of the business code is completely decoupled: tests
still run within the test framework, but the test subject's implementation runs in its own process.

This approach provides two major advantages:

- test certification: the test code (in the test framework) can be certified and developed individually. Changes there
  won't affect the client code.
- portability: running test framework compliance tests could be done in CI, or even as a `helm test`
- the test framework can record test runs in its system-of-records for future reference
